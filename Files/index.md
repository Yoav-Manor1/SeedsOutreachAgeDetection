The stand.png file keeps the camera high enough that it can recognize age. 

The Camera Case.png is the case for my camera. There is two holes, one for the camera, and one for the USB cable.

The AgeClass_MainApp.py file is the code I used to detect the age and gender of a person. The Videocapture() command from the OpenCV library is what allowed my project to use live video stream from the USB Camera.
