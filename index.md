# Final Milestone
<!--For your final milestone, explain the outcome of your project. Key details to include are:
- What you've accomplished since your previous milestone
- What your biggest challenges and triumphs were at BSE
- A summary of key topics you learned about
- What you hope to learn in the future after everything you've learned at BSE

# Second Milestone
<!--For your second milestone, explain what you've worked on since your previous milestone. You can highlight:
- Technical details of what you've accomplished and how they contribute to the final goal
- What has been surprising about the project so far
- Previous challenges you faced that you overcame
- What needs to be completed before your final milestone

# First Milestone
For my first milestone, I trained a model by downloading thousands of specific images. This was difficult to do because the images had to be preannotated. Although I had to find images online, I also had to transform them to represent different environments. For example, one transformation I made was to darken the image, which allows the model to still recognize people even if there is a shadow or shade. Another change I made was to add noise to the image. This is important because for the model to still recognize people even if there is dust or other particles in the way of parts of peoples' faces.

# Starter Project
For my starter project, I made a simon says game. I had to learn about different parts of my project. For example the capacitor, stores energy and releases it into a circuit when required. Another part I learned about is the microcontroller, which is like a small computer on a chip and it has a CPU. When I first learned to solder I found it difficult to not only use the solder machine but also keep everything organized. With each part that I soldered, I became better and better and finally felt confident after soldering the microcontroller which had lots of metal ends to solder. I also had problems with my project. For example, my LED lights were not working since I accidentally put them in the wrong way. I had to troubleshoot, and I learned how to desolder a part that was put in wrong.

# Schematics 
<!--
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. -->

# Code
<!--
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. -->

```c++

<!-- void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

Here's where you'll list the parts in your project. To add more rows, just copy and paste the example rows below.
Don't forget to place the link of where to buy each component inside the quotation marks in the corresponding row after href =. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize this to your project needs.

# Other Resources/Examples
<!--
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
